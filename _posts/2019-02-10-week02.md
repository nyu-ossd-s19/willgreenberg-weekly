## Our Firefox Extension: Tabi-Clock
We decided to make a nicer default page for Firefox with a simple greeting and an analog clock showing the current time. I personally fixed some formatting issues and styled the site with different div layouts, proportions for all of the drawn elements, and new font choices. Now, the page shows the entire clock and greeting without any clipping (as reasonable window sizes) as it had been originally.

Thus far, ensuring that all visual elements worked together comfortably and beautifully without any clipping outside the view area was challenging, as I was new to the libraries we were using (and I've barely used Javascript before). We have a working product now, but there is functionality that we still need to implement, such as user-customizable settings that persist.

## Learning about Git
I learned a LOT about git this week. I had used it before for basic version control as a single editor (doing my own projects) and for backups/submitting assignments. However, this week I had a lot of firsts: first issues opened/closed, first pull requests, first fork, first branch, and first merge. It's a lot to grasp and get used to, but practicing with our Firefox extension project has been very helpful. These tools have been extremely practical for working with my group on our extension -- I'm not sure how we would've been able to do it properly without them!
