## Collaborating on Tabi-Clock
Working on our Firefox extension Tabi-Clock was actually the first time I'd worked in a group on code. I was excited to try it, especially since real-world work involves lots of collaboration. Making the transition from writing code just for myself to writing for a team was totally smooth and fun: my teammates and I maintained an open and constructive dialogue, which made dividing up work and shifting our goals as we went very easy. We worked separately the entire time, keeping in touch over a messenger app for any general questions and to try to avoid merge conflicts. My main contribution involved restyling the basic clock and layout code, which both of my teammates approved of. I figured I would give a redesign a shot, then I made a pull request so the team could see if they liked it before merging to the main branch. Using the Git and GitHub workflow made collaboration really efficient and easy to understand, especially after a little practice. 

This was also one of my first times reading through code someone else had written in order to understand and add to it. This was an interesting new challenge, especially since I haven't used Javascript much at all before, and it helped me pick up the language really quickly.
