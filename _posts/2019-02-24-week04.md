# Project Evaluation 


__Project Name: Bitcoin__  

I've long been curious about how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work, so this felt like a good project to explore contributing to. I don't know much about the technologies involved, so I figure it would be a great learning experience -- I just need to determine if it wouldn't be too hard to work on it myself.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
Pretty friendly, but would require a fair amount of research into the documentation and codebase in order to make a meaningful contribution (but then again, what wouldn't?)

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Mixed bag, but largely yes.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
People seem friendly enough, if not mostly down to business. Nothing wrong with that though.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes, pretty consistently.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Sometimes.
