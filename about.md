I grew up on Long Island and went to UCLA for 2.5 years before transferring to NYU to study Computer Science. I'm a coder, a filmmaker, a photographer, musician, and lover of great design. If you wanna see some of my work, please check out my portfolio [here](https://will-greenberg.com). Enjoy :)

### More Information

Last January, I transferred to NYU from UCLA in order to pursue CS with more academic freedom. I loved UCLA for its community, opportunities to get involved in countless clubs and organizations, and its sheer scale of spirit and fun. However, as someone with disparate interests who loves taking classes in things like music and game design in addtion to CS, UCLA's rigid major structure left me without an easy way to take what I wanted, and staying would've meant compromising on almost a years' worth of classwork. So I came here, and I've absolutely loved every class I've had the pleasure of taking.
